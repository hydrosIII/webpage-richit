# webpage-richit

Web page for Rich IT made with Jekyll.

To build the webpage you need Jekyll installed in your system, so you need Ruby.

A pre built fixed image of the webpage can be found inside _site ready for deployment.

For testing you must change the _config.yml to use http://127.0.0.1:4000 instead of the 
official URL so you can view files in yor local machine.

It can be deployed almost anywhere as it is static. Even on github pages, to savve money !!

The original images and some templates are still inside for future refence.
